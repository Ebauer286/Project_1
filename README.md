We collected data from the Top 100 Billboard API and Spotify API's for this project. (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-features) 
We were unable to find a working API to collect Genre data. While we could succesfully draw many conclusions from the API's we did have access to, having genre data would have allowed us to be more thorough and allow for deeper comparisons such as how the change in loudness of music differed over the decades with the change of popularity in certain genres. 
The following weeks did not have Billboard data and were therefore not included:
  -1984-02-18
  -1989-03-11
Some songs at the end of the Top 100 lists had ties therefore some songs were cut off in favor of the first song to hit the lowest count on the top 100
Aproximately two dozen song ID's could not be found when cross referencing the Billboard to the Spotify lists and therefore were removed from the data set
All analysis conclusions are drawn within the parameters of Spotify data.
